  This is <strong>NOT</strong> a library. It's a collection of re-usable React
  custom hooks that you can copy and paste into your apps.
</p>

<strong>What do you mean by not a library?</strong>

<p>
  I mean you do not install it as a dependency. It is not available or
  distributed via npm.
</p>

<p>
  Pick the hook you need. Copy and paste the code into your project and
  customize to your needs. The code is yours.

## FAQ

<h6>Why copy/paste and not packaged as a dependency?</h6>

The idea behind this is to give you ownership and control over the code, allowing you to decide how the hooks are built.

Start with some sensible defaults, then customize the hooks to your needs.

One drawback of packaging custom hooks into a library is that the logic is coupled with its implementation. The reuse of your custom hooks should allow them to be easily copied and pasted into different contexts without relying on a specific setup.

<h6>Do you plan to publish it as an npm package?</h6>

No. I have no plans to publish it as an npm package.

<h6>Can I use this in my project?</h6>

Yes. Free to use for personal and commercial projects. No attribution required.

But hey, let me know if you do. I'd love to see what you build.
