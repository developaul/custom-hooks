<p class="opacity-90 mb-8">
  A set of reusable React custom hooks that you can copy and paste into your
  apps. Customizable. Open Source.
</p>

<p class="mb-8">
  This is <strong>NOT</strong> a library. It's a collection of re-usable React
  custom hooks that you can copy and paste into your apps.
</p>

<strong>What do you mean by not a library?</strong>

<p>
  I mean you do not install it as a dependency. It is not available or
  distributed via npm.
</p>

<p>
  Pick the hook you need. Copy and paste the code into your project and
  customize to your needs. The code is yours.
</p>

<i>Use this as a reference to build your own library of hook utilities.</i>
